<h2 id="wic" style="color:lime">What is Coronavirus?</h2>
<p style="color:#c04769">Corona, a name everyone is way too familiar with these days, except the toddlers,obviously! We never in our wildest dreams could have imagined that a microbe will bring death to thousands of people taking a form of<b> pandemic</b>. We were trying to outstand each other's powerful bombs and missiles collection and now we are struck in our houses with none of those(bomb and missiles) to come to our rescue. We never heard our names being called in our life so much as we have heard the term <b> Corona </b> in the last few months. The whole world is locked in their homes, countries under total lockdown. We are witnsessing a global pause, in a simple language to call it.<b> Novel Corona virus or covid-19 </b>, as you may call it, was first spotted in a small town <b> Wuhan, China</b>.</p>

<p style="color:#c04769"> It was first discovered in <b> november 2019 </b> and it took around two months to realize how terrifying this thing was. Being contagious made it worse, the symptoms appearing like a common cough and cold, taking a fortnight to discover if one is actually contaminated. In the meantime, a new lot comes forward being affected. This chain reaction soon engulfed countries with even the best medical facilities, killing thousands in a week.</p>

<h2 id="nac" style="color:lime">Nature And Corona.</h2>
<p style="color:#c04769">But hey! Every coin has two sides: good and bad. Corona is no different. Infact, it has come out as a boon for our earth. The humans really created havoc globally, be it pollution, population, global warming, deforestation and what not! But as we are staying in our homes now, trapped within the walls, nature is returning to its better form, its healing. There have been evidences world wide showing how lots of species have returned to their native places. Be it sea animals, birds or animals on land, the nature seems happy again. The climatic contiditions are changing, pollution rates have dropped low, skies are clearer tham it was ever in the last few decades, air is pure, ozone has healed itself and what not! Why not have a glimps of some of these beauties?  </p>
